## Trustworthy and Efficient LLMs Meet Databases

In the rapidly evolving AI era with large language models LLMs at the core,
making LLMs more trustworthy and efficient, especially in output generation
inference, has gained significant attention. This is to reduce plausible but
faulty LLM outputs a.k.a hallucinations and meet the highly incre...

## Large Language Models as Software Components: A Taxonomy for
  LLM-Integrated Applications

Large Language Models LLMs have become widely adopted recently. Research
explores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software
engineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software
systems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be
impossible...

## Parrot: Efficient Serving of LLM-based Applications with Semantic
  Variable

The rise of large language models LLMs has enabled LLM-based applications
a.k.a. AI agents or co-pilots, a new software paradigm that combines the
strength of LLM and conventional software. Diverse LLM applications from
different tenants could design complex workflows using multiple LLM requests...

## LLM Online Spatial-temporal Signal Reconstruction Under Noise

This work introduces the LLM Online Spatial-temporal Reconstruction LLM-OSR
framework, which integrates Graph Signal Processing GSP and Large Language
Models LLMs for online spatial-temporal signal reconstruction. The LLM-OSR
utilizes a GSP-based spatial-temporal signal handler to enhance grap...

## What Limits LLM-based Human Simulation: LLMs or Our Design?

We argue that advancing LLM-based human simulation requires addressing both
LLMs inherent limitations and simulation framework design challenges. Recent
studies have revealed significant gaps between LLM-based human simulations and
real-world observations, highlighting these dual challenges. To add...
